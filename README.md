# 3D-Fractal-Generator
This was an Honors project completed for CS 212 at Calvin University.
The program generates one of three 3-dimensional fractals: a fern, a tree, or terrain.
  
The terrain is generated using a midpoint-displacement algorithm, while the fern and the tree are created using turtle graphics and a Lindenmayer system.

Run by executing Project03Fractals.exe in bin/debug.
